Did you know that although the play was titled \"Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\", J. M.

Then she gave\r\nMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear\r\nthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a\r\nhorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she said,\r\n“it’s your medicine!”\r\n\n\r\n“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\r\nWendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing\r\nmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”\r\n\n\r\nAnd still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted.\r\n“Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,\r\nwhy should I be coddled—why, why, why!”\r\n\n\r\n“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the\r\nservants will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling\r\nLiza the servants.\r\n\n\r\n“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole\r\nworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour\r\nlonger.”\r\n\n\r\nThe children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He\r\nfelt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;\r\n“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\r\nthis instant.”\r\n\n\r\n“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I\r\ntold you about that boy.”\r\n\n\r\nAlas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that\r\nhouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out\r\nof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the\r\nnursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his\r\ntoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up\r\nin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his\r\nknuckles to his eyes.\r\n\n\r\nIn the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silenc\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a tokenizer\ntokenizer = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer(r'\\w+')\n\n# Tokenizing the text\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n\n# Printing out the first 8 words / tokens \nprint(tokens[:11])","execution_count":83,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['The', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'eBook', 'of', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'by', 'James', 'M', 'Barrie']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make all words lowercase\nwords = [token.lower() for token in tokens]\n\n# load stop words\nstop_words = stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words(\"english\")\n\n# Remove stop words\nfiltered_words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]","execution_count":84,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Printing the first 5 words_ns to check that stop words are gone\nprint(filtered_words[0:5])","execution_count":85,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['project', 'gutenberg', 'ebook', 'peter', 'pan']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize a Counter object from our processed list of words\ncount = Counter(filtered_words)\n\n# Store 10 most common words and their counts as top_ten\ntop_ten = count.most_common(10)\n\n# Print the top ten words and their counts\nprint(top_ten)","execution_count":86,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"[('peter', 409), ('wendy', 362), ('said', 358), ('would', 217), ('one', 212), ('hook', 174), ('could', 142), ('cried', 136), ('john', 133), ('time', 126)]\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"protagonists = [\"hook\", \"john\", \"peter\", \"wendy\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
